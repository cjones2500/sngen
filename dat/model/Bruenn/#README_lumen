        Here is the luminosity and <E> data that you
requested. I have appended two files, one with data
for S15s7b and the other for data S25s7b. Headings
with _e, _eb, and _x correspond to e-neutrinos, e-
antineutrinos, and one of mu or tau neutrinos or
antineutrinos. Let me know if you have any questions.
