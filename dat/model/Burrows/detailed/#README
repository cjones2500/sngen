The focus is on breakout.  The first column is energy_electron.type (MeV),
the second colu mn is the luminosity spectrum (10^{54} ergs/s/MeV), and
the third/fourth and fifth/six th columns are the corresponding data for
the anti-electron types and the total for the mu/tau (and anti-mu/tau)
types, respectively.  The time in seconds is given at the top left-hand
corner of the corresponding block of data. This work is described in
Thompson, Burrows, and Pinto (2002, astro-ph/0211194).
