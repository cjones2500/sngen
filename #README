                 How to Use the SNO Supernova Generator
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updated: September 10, 2004 by Jaret Heise

Here are steps to follow when using the SNO Supernova Generator code:

0. Edit the Makefile and uncomment/comment out the appropriate machine/
   platform settings.

1. Edit the user file: 'sn_user.dat' which is found in the top level of
   the 'dat' directory:

	o dat/sn_user.dat

2. Make sure the output directories are created.  By default, the output
   directories are the following:

	o ./sam         (sampling output)
	o ./snoman/new  (needed if MCPL and cmd files are being output)
	o ./xsect       (needed only if xsect data is output) 

   The design of the program is such that memory is sacrificed for speed.
   Many of the calculations are done only once and stored in (rather large)
   arrays.  The sampled particle information is written to file to make
   regeneration of the SNOMAN command and MCPL files easier in the event that
   only those files need to be changed.

3. If you have changed the model being used, you *will* need to edit the
   following files:

	o energy_size.inc
        o time_size.inc      (default is fine, but change for count stats)
        o sn_flux.f          (if changing from Burrows/B&V -> Bruenn/Mezz)
	o flux_size.inc
        o file_flux_size.inc (for Bruenn and Mezzacappa models)

   There are notes in these files saying what needs to be commented and
   uncommented depending on the model chosen. The values that need changing
   govern the size of the storage arrays discussed above.

4. If the distance is fairly close, you may need to edit the following
   files:

	o sn_count_size.inc   (total number of neutrinos currently 125000)
	o sample_count_size.inc (largest number per interaction currently 
          55000)

    The current settings are good for 100 supernovae at 10 kpc, or
    alternatively, for 1 supernova at 1 kpc

5. If you want to increase the number of energy or time steps, you will
   need to increase the array size in:

	o flux_size.inc

   as well as edit the "read_user.f" file where the step sizes are specified.

6. Recompile the source code.

7. Provide a link to the executable in the src directory:

	o ln -s src/sngen sngen

8. Run the generator executable: 'sngen'

     -> at the moment you interactively chose which reactions to look at
     -> to run all interactions and send the standard output to a file, use: 

           "sngen < input/input_all >& sngen-100x10kpc.log"

9. For producing the Ecountrate instead of the countrate in time, use sngen_bk

        o Burrows model takes a *long* time, so use Beacom & Vogel
        o probably don't want to sample

10. Files needed by the SNOMAN analysis of the SN ZDAB files are located in:

        o snoman/analysis

    Rather than put everything in the create_cmd.f routine, more and more 
    emphasis will be placed on these files.
